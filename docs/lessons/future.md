# Future

When we know about the future, we normally use the present tense.

1. We use the present simple for something scheduled:

- We have a lesson next Monday.
- The train arrives at 6.30 in the morning.
- The holidays start next week.
- It's my birthday tomorrow.

2. We can use the present continuous for plans or arrangements:

- I'm playing football tomorrow.
- They are coming to see us tomorrow.
- We're having a party at Christmas.

3. We use will:

when we express beliefs about the future:
- It will be a nice day tomorrow.
- I think Brazil will win the World Cup.
- I'm sure you will enjoy the film.

to mean want to or be willing to:
- I hope you will come to my party.
- George says he will help us.

to make offers and promises :
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- We'll send you an email.

to talk about offers and promises:
- Tim will be at the meeting.
- Mary will help with the cooking.

4. We use be going to:

to talk about plans or intentions:
- I'm going to drive to work today.
- They are going to move to Manchester.

to make predictions based on evidence we can see:
- Be careful! You are going to fall. (= I can see that you might fall.)
- Look at those black clouds. I think it's going to rain. (= I can see that it will rain.)

## The future in time clauses and if-clauses

In time clauses with words like when, after, until we often use present tense forms to talk about the future:

- I'll come home when I finish work.
- You must wait here until your father comes.
- They are coming after they have had dinner.

In clauses with if we often use present tense forms to talk about the future:

- We won't be able to go out if it is raining.
- If Barcelona lose tomorrow, they will be champions.

## But careful!

Although we do not normally use will in time clauses and if-clauses:
- I'll come home when I finish work. (NOT will finish work)
- We wonâ€™t be able to go out if it rains. (NOT will rain)

but we can use will if it means want to or be willing to:

- I will be very happy if you will come to my party.
- We should finish the job early if George will help us.
