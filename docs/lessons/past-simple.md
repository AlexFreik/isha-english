## Introduction:

Most English verbs form the past tense by adding -ed to the base form.

- like → liked
- want → wanted

A Specific Event in the Past:
Example: "I **met** my wife in 1983."
Repeated Actions in the Past:
Example: "When I **was** a boy, I **walked** a mile to school every day."
A Continued Truth in the Past:
Example: "I **lived** abroad for ten years."
Using 'Ago' with Past Simple:
## The word "ago" is often used with the past simple tense to indicate how far back in the past something happened.

Example: "I met my wife a long time ago."
