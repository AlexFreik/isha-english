# Past Simple

Objective: By the end of this lesson, students will be able to identify and use regular and irregular past tense forms in English correctly.

## Introduction:

Most English verbs form the past tense by adding -ed to the base form.
Examples:
- call → called
- like → liked
- want → wanted
- work → worked
However, English also has a number of irregular verbs that do not follow this pattern.

## Usage of Past Tense:
We use the past tense to talk about:

A Specific Event in the Past:
Example: "I **met** my wife in 1983."
Repeated Actions in the Past:
Example: "When I **was** a boy, I **walked** a mile to school every day."
A Continued Truth in the Past:
Example: "I **lived** abroad for ten years."
Using 'Ago' with Past Simple:
## The word "ago" is often used with the past simple tense to indicate how far back in the past something happened.

Example: "I met my wife a long time **ago**."
